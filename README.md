# Instructor
Sudhan Chitgopkar
([`sudhanchitgopkar@g.harvard.edu`](mailto:sudhanchitgopkar@g.harvard.edu))
is a Master's student in Harvard's Computational Science & Engineering
Master's program. He has been exploring Generative Art and visualization
for 3 years, and has given one of the most viewed TEDx talks on the
subject. Sudhan's interests in generative art are specifically focused
on visualizing patterns that exist in nature -- from fractals to
artificial life simulations and everything in between.

# Course Description

*What do fractals, flocks of birds, and figure skating have in common?*

Code the Universe is a practical, beginner's guide to generative and
algorithmic art with a focus on visualizing the beautiful natural and
mathematical phenomena that makes up our everyday world. Over our two
weeks together, we'll

-   get acquainted with the field of generative art and tools of the
    trade

-   dive into discussions about beautiful natural phenomena

-   do live-coding demonstrations visualizing everything from bouncing
    light rays to birds to the solar system

You'll leave Code the Universe with a few of your own pieces of
generative art, and the tools you need to visualize whatever interests
you most! **All experience levels are welcome.**

# Course Objectives

This course seeks to (1) help students develop an interest and
understanding in the math that surrounds them and (2) build the skills
necessary to visualize patterns and phenomena interesting to them in
nature and beyond. To that end, this course will spend the first two
lectures introducing students to the landscape of Generative Art and the
tools (and math) which may help them visualize the natural world. The
last four lectures will investigate all sorts of puzzles and phenomena
in nature which are fascinating and beautiful, giving students an
understanding of how to visualize them. Students should leave this
course able to identify different types of patterns in nature and where
they come from, and the ability to create art out of these patterns.

# Course Policies & Expectations

This course will consist of 6 lectures, each covering a topic integral
to a foundational understanding of Generative Art and visualizing
natural phenomena. Students enrolled in the course are expected to
attend each lecture to keep up with course material having reviewed the
pre-lecture material. This material is intentionally short, quite
accessible, and quite fun!

Even a brief glance through most of the
material, especially for later modules, will provide a brief insight
into how beautiful and complex the visualizations of lecture material
can be. Students are also highly encouraged to complete the coding
assignments (see "Assignments" section) between each lecture and submit
their work for feedback or help with questions. Coding assignments may
be submitted at any point throughout the course for feedback, though it
would be prudent to keep up with coding assignments as the
implementation for concepts presented build on top of each other
throughout the course.

# Materials & Access

All materials for this course are free/publicly available. Pre-lecture
readings/videos are all accessible via YouTube or are freely available
academic papers, and are linked in the course schedule. All assignments
and code developed during the course will be hosted on the course
web-page under a public license, and students are encouraged to modify
this code as they wish.

# Assignments

Students can expect optional but *highly encouraged* readings/videos and
one coding assignment after each class. While it is possible to follow
the course without doing any work outside of class, this course is much
more interesting and enriching if you tinker with the code we write and
the visualizations we make by yourself. Some of the most interesting
visualizations come from asking yourself "why?" and "what if?" questions
that can't be answered without getting your hands dirty and trying to
write/rewrite/modify the questions and code we explore.

Though optional,
any coding assignments turned in will be returned by the next class with
feedback from the instructor so that you can gauge your progress or get
help with any particularly annoying bugs in your code. Three different
coding assignments will be available for students to complete after each
lecture. One will be geared towards beginners, focused on modifying some
of the parameters of the code shown in class to better understand
how/why it works. Intermediate assignments will focus on implementing
some of the examples shown in class from scratch, and incorporating
minor modifications to them. Advanced assignments will focus on
optimizing the code shown in class or making more significant,
structural modifications to the models presented and implementing
visualizations for them.

# Academic Integrity

Generative art and creative coding is a pursuit that is, well, creative!
To that end, students are encouraged to take full advantage of any and
all resources they find helpful -- from generative AI to Stack Overflow
to one another! It is the instructor's hope that students will continue
to engage with this content beyond this course and that they fully
understand which tools may be helpful in their visualization pursuits.
Students must, however, acknowledge/cite sources for code that they have
taken from others and not pass off the work of others as their own.

# Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Harvard University values inclusive excellence and providing equal
educational opportunities for all students. Our goal is to remove
barriers for disabled students related to inaccessible elements of
instruction or design in this course. If reasonable accommodations are
necessary to provide access, please contact the [Disability Access
Office (DAO)](https://aeo.fas.harvard.edu/). Accommodations do not alter
fundamental requirements of the course and are not retroactive. Students
should request accommodations as early as possible, since they may take
time to implement. Students should notify DAO at any time during the
semester if adjustments to their communicated accommodation plan are
needed.
